Under construction and will possibly never be finished.

## wat

A hare-brained idea to simulate catching Pokemon in R.

## Approach

I'm planning on a couple of functions: encounter() and catch()

Encounters are decided by rarity and some randomness.

Catch success is decided by catch rates and some randomness.

It would be good to have some kind of inventory of balls or something. The ball type would influence catch rate. You only have so many balls to make captures.
